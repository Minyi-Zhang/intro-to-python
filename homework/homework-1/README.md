# Homework 1

The program should ask 3 questions:

1. What is your first name?
2. How old are you?
3. How many pets do you have?

Then the program should output:

> Hello _name_. Great to meet someone who is age years old with _number of pets_ pets.

For example, if I enter the following answers

1. What is your first name? `Ali`
2. How old are you? `20`
3. How many pets do you have? `03`

The output should be:

> Hello Ali. Great to meet someone who is 20 years old with 3 pets.
